## Lessons Learned

This project brought alot of the concepts we have been going over together. The importance of how a table should look in SQL and how they communicate with all the other aspects was good to go over. Further mapping and how they communicate with other tables will be another key aspect. While developing this app, I used past work problems with the skill set I had at the time, mainly excel, to combat issues companies facewhen it comes to maintennace. I'm happy I was able to create something better with the new skills I have aquired.
